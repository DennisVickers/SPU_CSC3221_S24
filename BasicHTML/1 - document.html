  <h1>Anatomy of an HTML document</h1>
  <div>
    <h3>doctype</h3>
    <p>Identifies the type of document. Doesnâ€™t do much now.</p>
    <h3>html</h3>
    <p>Wraps all the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element. It also includes the lang attribute, setting the primary language of the document.</p>
    <h3>head</h3>
    <p>Holds everything to include on the page that isn't the content to be shown. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.</p>
    <h3>meta charset</h3>
    <p>Sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages.</p>
    <h3>meta name and content</h3>
    <p>Ensures the page renders at the width of viewport, preventing mobile browsers from rendering pages wider than the viewport and then shrinking them down.</p>
    <h3>title</h3>
    <p>Sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.</p>
    <h3>body</h3>
    <p>Contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.</p>
